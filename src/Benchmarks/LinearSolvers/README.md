# TNL Benchmark: Linear Solvers

This benchmark tool compares the performance of various linear solvers using the Template Numerical Library (TNL). It supports several external libraries for direct and iterative solvers, including:

- [UMFPACK](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) (SuiteSparse)
- [STRUMPACK](https://github.com/pghysels/STRUMPACK)
- [Ginkgo](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo)
- [cuDSS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudss)
- [cuSOLVER](https://developer.nvidia.com/cusolver)
